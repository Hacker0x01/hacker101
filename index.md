Getting Started
---------------

Hacker101 is structured as a set of video lessons -- some covering multiple topics, some covering a single one -- and can be consumed in two different ways.  You can either watch them in the order produced as in a normal class ([§](#sessions) Sessions), or you can watch individual videos ([§](#vulnerabilities) Vulnerabilities).  If you're new to security, we recommend the former; this provides a guided path through the content and covers more than just individual bugs.

Additionally, we have a [CTF (Capture The Flag)](https://ctf.hacker101.com/) where you can hunt for bugs and experiment with exploitation in practice.  You can access that [here](https://ctf.hacker101.com/).
