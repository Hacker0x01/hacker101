Welcome to Hacker101! For those new to bug bounties and web hacking, we recommend starting with our [Newcomers Playlist](/playlists/newcomers). This playlist covers fundamental aspects such as web application basics, cultivating a hacker mindset, and crafting effective reports.

In addition to the Newcomers Playlist, we advise getting yourself familiair with [Burp Suite](/playlists/burp_suite), mastering the essentials of [Web Hacking](/playlists/web_hacking), and reviewing the _"Report Writing, Communication Tips, and Community Guidelines"_ section on this page to effectively engage with triage and security teams.

A large collection of hacking tools, like web, desktop, and mobile tools, scanners, datasets, and other valuable resources can be found on the [Resources](/resources) page. Be sure to check them out and get familiar with them.

Hacker101 also offers Capture the Flag (CTF) levels to practice what you've learned and increase your skills. When reaching a total of 26 points in the CTF, you become eligible for [invitations to private programs](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/invitations.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper). Whether you’re a new hacker or you’re just new to our platform, this is a great way for you to dive into the deep end from day one. Join in on the fun on <a href="https://ctf.hacker101.com/" target="_blank">Hacker101 CTF</a>!

Good luck, and happy hacking!
