title: Exploitation resources
---

This is a curated list of exploitation resources and is not intended to be comprehensive; rather, we want to highlight the tools we find especially useful.

* [NoSQLMap](https://github.com/codingo/NoSQLMap): NoSQLMap is an open source Python tool designed to audit for, as well as automate injection attacks, and exploit default configuration weaknesses in NoSQL databases and web applications using NoSQL to disclose or clone data from the database.
* [Retire.JS](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/retire-js/): Scanning website for vulnerable js libraries.
* [Spiderfoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot): SpiderFoot is an open source intelligence (OSINT) automation tool. It integrates with just about every data source available, and automates OSINT collection so that you can focus on data analysis.
* [Sqlmap](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap): sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester, and a broad range of switches including: database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, accessing the underlying file system, and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.
* [SQLNinja](http://sqlninja.sourceforge.net/): Sqlninja is a tool targeted to exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities on a web application that uses Microsoft SQL Server as its back-end.
* [SSRFTest](https://github.com/daeken/SSRFTest): SSRF testing tool.
* [XSS hunter](https://xsshunter.com/): XSS Hunter allows you to find all kinds of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, including the often-missed blind XSS. The service works by hosting specialized XSS probes which, upon firing, scan the page and send information about the vulnerable page to the XSS Hunter service.
* [Ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial): A proof-of-concept tool for generating payloads that exploit unsafe Java object deserialization.
