This is a curated list of Burp plugins and is not intended to be comprehensive; rather, we want to highlight the plugins we find especially useful.

* [ActiveScan++](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/3123d5b5f25c4128894d97ea1acc4976): ActiveScan++ extends Burp Suite's active and passive scanning capabilities. Designed to add minimal network overhead, it identifies application behavior that may be of interest to advanced testers.
* [Autorepeater Burp](https://github.com/nccgroup/AutoRepeater): Automated HTTP request repeating with Burp Suite.
* [Autorize Burp](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/f9bbac8c4acf4aefa4d7dc92a991af2f): Autorize is an extension aimed at helping the penetration tester to detect authorization vulnerabilities —one of the more time-consuming tasks in a web application penetration test.
* [Burp Beautifier](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/a005a6a8fba34a8893ec649f76a8d5a7): BurpBeautifier is a Burpsuite extension for beautifying request/response body, supporting JS, JSON, HTML, XML format, writing in Jython 2.7.
* [BurpSentinel](https://github.com/dobin/BurpSentinel): With BurpSentinel it is possible for the penetration tester to quickly and easily send a lot of malicious requests to parameters of a HTTP request. Not only that, but it also shows a lot of information of the HTTP responses, corresponding to the attack requests. It's easy to find low-hanging fruit and hidden vulnerabilities like this, and it also allows the tester to focus on more important stuff!
* [Flow](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/ee1c45f4cc084304b2af4b7e92c0a49d): This extension provides a Proxy history-like view along with search filter capabilities for all Burp tools.
* [Headless Burp](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/d54b11f7af3c4dfeb6b81fb5db72e381): This extension allows you to run Burp Suite's Spider and Scanner tools in headless mode via the command-line.
* [JSON_Beautifier](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/309ef28d45ff4f19bedfed3896cb3ca9): This plugin provides a JSON tab with beautified representation of the request/response.
* [Logger++](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/470b7057b86f41c396a97903377f3d81): Logger++ is a multi-threaded logging extension for Burp Suite. In addition to logging requests and responses from all Burp Suite tools, the extension allows advanced filters to be defined to highlight interesting entries or filter logs to only those which match the filter.
* [WSDL Wizard](https://portswigger.net/bappstore/ef2f3f1a593d417987bb2ddded760aee): This extension scans a target server for WSDL files. After performing normal mapping of an application's content, right click on the relevant target in the site map, and choose "Scan for WSDL files" from the context menu. The extension will search the already discovered contents for URLs with the .wsdl file extension, and guess the locations of any additional WSDL files based on the file names known to be in use. The results of the scanning appear within the extension's output tab in the Burp Extender tool.
