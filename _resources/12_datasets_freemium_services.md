title: Datasets / Freemium services
---

This is a curated list of datasets and freemium services and is not intended to be comprehensive; rather, we want to highlight the tools we find especially useful.

* [C99.nl](https://api.c99.nl/): Subdomain Finder is a scanner that scans an entire domain to find as many subdomains as possible.
* [Censys](https://censys.io/): Censys scans the most ports and houses the biggest certificate database in the world, and provides the most up-to-date,  thorough view of your known and unknown assets.
* [Payloads All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings): A list of useful payloads and bypasses for Web Application Security. Feel free to improve with your payloads and techniques.
* [Rapid7 Forward DNS (FDNS)](https://opendata.rapid7.com/sonar.fdns_v2/): This dataset contains the responses to DNS requests for all forward DNS names known by Rapid7's Project Sonar.
* [Seclists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists): SecLists is the security tester's companion. It's a collection of multiple types of lists used during security assessments, collected in one place. List types include usernames, passwords, URLs, sensitive data patterns, fuzzing payloads, web shells, and many more. The goal is to enable a security tester to pull this repository onto a new testing box and have access to every type of list that may be needed.
* [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/): Shodan provides a public API that allows other tools to access all of Shodan's data. Integrations are available for Nmap, Metasploit, Maltego, FOCA, Chrome, Firefox and many more.
