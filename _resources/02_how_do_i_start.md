title: I'm new to all of this; how do I get started?
---

Congratulations on taking the first step to becoming a hacker! We recommend starting with our [Hacker101 for Newcomers](/playlists/newcomers) and [Burp Suite](/playlists/burp_suite) playlists. Once you've completed that, start working through the [Hacker101 CTF](https://ctf.hacker101.com/) and watching the other [video lessons](/videos) as you need them. While there are no prerequisites for Hacker101, strictly speaking, there are things you can learn to accelerate your hacking education. Note that you don't need to know all of this -- or any -- to get started. Here's a curated list of resources:

* Programming
    * [JavaScript](https://javascript.info/): This is the language used on the majority of web pages. Understanding it is useful for bug hunting because many bugs actually stem from JS code.
    * [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/): Commonly used for automating various activities during testing, as well as being useful for general programming.
    * [SQL](https://sqlbolt.com/): Used by most applications for accessing and manipulating data. Knowledge of SQL will help in discovering and exploiting critical SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

* Networking
    * [Terminology guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-networking-terminology-interfaces-and-protocols): You'll hear many terms from IP address to port to DNS. This guide will help you understand that.
    * [Common Port Numbers](https://www.utilizewindows.com/list-of-common-network-port-numbers/): A useful list of common port numbers and the associated services.

* Linux
    * [Setting up your own web server](https://www.linux.com/learn/easy-lamp-server-installation): While not security-related in itself, this will teach you many of the commands and concepts you need to know to become a great hacker.
    * [Setting up Kali Linux on Virtualbox](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-install-kali-linux-on-virtualbox): Kali is a hacking-oriented Linux distribution, used by many bug hunters. This guide will help you set it up in a virtual machine.
    * [Command Line Guide](https://lifehacker.com/a-command-line-primer-for-beginners-5633909?IR=T): You'll end up using many command-line tools as a hacker, so a familiarity with its structure and use is valuable.
