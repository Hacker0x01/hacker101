We recommend [signing up](https://hackerone.com/users/sign_up){:target="_blank"} for a HackerOne account and checking out our extensive programs. Additionally, you can earn invitations to private programs on HackerOne via the [Hacker101 CTF](https://ctf.hacker101.com/){:target="_blank"}. This gets you into programs with fewer hackers, often making it easier to find interesting and impactful bugs.
