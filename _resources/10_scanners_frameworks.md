title: Scanners / Frameworks
---

This is a curated list of scanners and frameworks and is not intended to be comprehensive; rather, we want to highlight the tools we find especially useful.

* [Canvas](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/canvas/): CANVAS offers hundreds of exploits, an automated exploitation system, and a comprehensive, reliable exploit development framework to penetration testers and security professionals worldwide.
* [IronWASP](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/ironwasp-part-1-2/): IronWASP (Iron Web Application Advanced Security testing Platform) is an open source tool used for web application vulnerability testing. It is designed in such a way that users having the right knowledge can create their own scanners using this as a framework. IronWASP is built using Python and Ruby and users having knowledge of them would be able to make full use of the platform. However, IronWASP provides a lot of features that are simple to understand.
* [Lazyrecon](https://github.com/nahamsec/lazyrecon): LazyRecon is a script written in Bash, intended to automate the tedious tasks of reconnaissance and information gathering. The information is organized in an html report at the end, which helps you identify next steps.
* [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/): Maltego is an open source intelligence (OSINT) and graphical link analysis tool for gathering and connecting information for investigative tasks.
* [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/): Metasploit is an open source penetration testing framework.
* [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2): Nikto is an Open Source (GPL) web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including over 6700 potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of over 1250 servers, and version specific problems on over 270 servers.
* [Nmap](https://nmap.org/): Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing.
* [OpenVAS](https://www.openvas.org/): OpenVAS is a full-featured vulnerability scanner. Its capabilities include unauthenticated testing, authenticated testing, various high level and low level Internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning for large-scale scans and a powerful internal programming language to implement any type of vulnerability test.
* [Osmedeus](https://github.com/j3ssie/Osmedeus): Osmedeus allows you to automatically run the collection of awesome tools for reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning against the target.
* [Reconness](https://github.com/reconness/reconness): ReconNess helps you to run and keep all your #recon in the same place allowing you to focus only on the potentially vulnerable targets without distraction and without requiring a lot of bash skill, or programming skill in general.
* [Sn1per](https://github.com/1N3/Sn1per): Sn1per Community Edition is an automated scanner that can be used during a penetration test to enumerate and scan for vulnerabilities. Sn1per Professional is Xero Security's premium reporting addon for Professional Penetration Testers, Bug Bounty Researchers and Corporate Security teams to manage large environments and pentest scopes.
* [Wapiti](https://wapiti.sourceforge.io/): Wapiti allows you to audit the security of your websites or web applications. It performs "black-box" scans (it does not study the source code) of the web application by crawling the web pages of the deployed webapp, looking for scripts and forms where it can inject data.
