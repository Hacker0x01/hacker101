In this episode we take a look at HackerOne’s federal initiatives and activity in the DoD space. It was an opportunity to demonstrate HackerOne as a tool that can be useful to military personnel transitioning to careers in the civilian world, while also tying in other initiatives that serve the veteran cyber community!
