We had the pleasure to speak with @TheCyberMentor and @PhillipWylie and asked all of our questions about how to get into pentesting! We had the chance to discuss online resources, learning platforms and certifications for people with different backgrounds and experience levels. Hosted by [@NahamSec](https://twitter.com/NahamSec) and [@Arl_rose](https://twitter.com/arl_rose).
