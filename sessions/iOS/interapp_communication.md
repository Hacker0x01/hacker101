iOS applications have various reasons to communicate with each other - for deep linking, third-party authentication, and simply sharing data.  In the third video in our iOS application hacking series, we’ll take a look at widely-used mechanisms for inter-app communication and how they can be abused when deployed insecurely.  We’ll focus on an in-depth look at the iOS pasteboard, URL schemes, and universal links, and demonstrate how to use Frida to trace and test this functionality.
