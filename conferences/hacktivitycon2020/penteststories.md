Abstract
-----------------
"This talk covers a few of my favorite stories from the past year and will demonstrate different ways that I managed to ""own"" an organization during a pentest engagement.  Stories include:

No MFA? Thanks! - This story discusses how I obtained domain admin access as an external attacker, teaching some key lessons along the way.
IPv6 FTW! - This story discusses how IPv6 can be abused in internal networks and easily allow for complete domain compromise.
You Spent How Much on Security? - This story discusses how I obtained domain controller access on an organization that was doing *almost* everything right and spending a lot of money to do so.
Digging Deep - This story discusses how I managed to take down an internal network when no apparent exploit existed."
