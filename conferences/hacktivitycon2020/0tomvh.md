About the Speaker 
-----------------
STÖK is a hacker, content creator, and creative with 25 years as a professional in Information Technology. STÖK is not only dedicated to bring excellent content and share new techniques to the red-team and bounty community but also strives to inspire the next generation of hackers to enter the infosec space.

Abstract
-----------------
STÖK gets asked "How do I get started in bug bounties?" every day, and it's been like that since the first day he began his own bounty journey about 2 years ago. In 2020, there are so many different paths to choose, and it can be really overwhelming for someone that wants to break into the hacking space. Should you focus on VDPs? Should you do CTFs? Should you spend your time doing recon? Should you automate stuff? Or should you go app deep? There is no right or wrong way to do it, but the most important thing is to simply take action, and simply just start hacking.
