Abstract
-----------------
This is the story of how a 14-year-old high school dropout ended up paired talking about iPhones with Tim Cook on the national news. How a technical practitioner whose only knowledge of business came from the Facebook movie became a funded startup founder by walking into a glass door on her first day at a startup accelerator. How that weird kid with funny hats ended up with government research funding but didn’t know what an invoice was to get the money. How the girl who everyone thought was just a member’s girlfriend at the local hacker meeting gave her first talk at Shmoocon and filled the room by offering free beer at 9am from a little red wagon. Through a series of vignettes, Georgia will discuss how she got here and how you can too!
